    "### Project Introduction\n",
    "Our data science project seeks to analyze and predict the playoff performance of NBA teams and individual players using a combination of regular season statistics and performance against playoff-caliber opponents. The goal is to determine whether we can accurately forecast postseason outcomes, such as a team’s playoff success or a player's postseason statline, based on regular season trends and contextualized performance data.\n",
    "One of the core issues with evaluating NBA performance is the distinct contrast between the regular season and the playoffs. Playoff games feature slower pace, increased defensive intensity, tighter rotations, and more targeted game planning. As a result, regular season metrics do not always carry over and some teams and players excel when the stakes are lower, while others elevate their game under pressure. This is an important issue for our stakeholders (NBA coaches, teams, analysts, and fans) because we seek to provide meaningful insight to the most important stretch of games in the NBA. This insight will be greatly important for understanding which players to give more minutes to in the playoffs, as giving the wrong players minutes can lead to a teams short exit in the postseason.\n",
    "To address this, we’re going beyond just overall regular season stats and win percentage. A key feature of our approach is to isolate regular season performance against other playoff-bound teams, under the assumption that these matchups more closely reflect the intensity and structure of playoff basketball. By focusing on how teams fare against high-level competition, we hope to identify patterns that traditional season-long averages might hide. Our interest in this topic stems from both a passion for basketball and the analytical challenges the NBA presents. With its rich dataset and clear regular season vs. postseason split, the NBA offers an ideal setting to explore how performance under pressure can be modeled and understood."

    "### Changes from Original Proposal\n",
    "One change that was made from the original proposal is to include more data from different years. Previously, we planned on using only the regular season for 2024-2025, but we quickly realized that we need to provide other years for our model to train on so it can accurately predict playoff outcomes. That is why we dedcided on using the previous three years of regular season and playoff data in our approach."
